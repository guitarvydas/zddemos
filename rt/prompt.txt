Create a javascript program called `decodeoutput.js` that receives a string of characters on stdin.
The string of character is a single JSON array containing JSON objects that are key/value pairs of strings.
Decodedoutput.js creates 4 files
1. out.lisp
2. out.py
3. out.js
4. out.txt.
The files are initially empty. The value of each JSON object is appended to the corresponding output file, determined by the key of each incoming JSON object.
When finished, the files are closed and stored in the file system.
